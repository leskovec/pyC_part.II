# Pybind11 Modules - Libraries Tutorial

Welcome to the Pybind11 Modules "Libraries" tutorial! This repository provides a step-by-step guide on how to use Pybind11 to create a simple Python module that interfaces with libraries you can easily include in C++.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- CMake (3.12 or higher)
- Python (>3.6)
- C++ Compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- Pybind11 (We'll include this in the tutorial)

## How to set it up
